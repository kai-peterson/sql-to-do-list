## Description

This was my first project using a database (postgresSQL). It's a simple to-do list with some basic CSS styling. You can create, read, update, and delete tasks in this full stack app. The banana background may be a bit much; I was just having some fun styling this one. Check out my first React app [My React Gallery](https://github.com/kai-peterson/my-react-gallery) for a more professionally styled app.

Features:
- Add task
- Delete task
- Mark task completed
- Multiple tables to sort tasks
